# ACP v2 Example

This example demonstrates **ACP v2** integration flows using a buyer-seller interaction pattern.

- **Position Management**: Custom job definitions for opening and closing trading positions
- **Token Swapping**: User-defined jobs for swapping between different tokens
- **Fund Transfers**: Utilizing ACP's escrow and transfer infrastructure

## Files

- **Swap Tokens**: Perform token swaps through the service provider
- **Interactive CLI**: Provides a command-line interface for real-time interaction

**Key Features:**
- Automatic payment handling for negotiation phase
- Interactive menu for testing different fund operations
- Real-time job status monitoring
- Support for multiple position management operations

### `seller.py` - Fund Management Service Provider
The seller agent demonstrates how to:
- **Accept Fund Requests**: Handle incoming fund management requests
- **Process Payments**: Manage payable memos and escrow transfers
- **Provide Services**: Execute fund management operations
- **Client State Management**: Track client wallets, assets, and positions
- **Task Handling**: Support multiple task types (open/close positions, swaps, withdrawals)

**Supported Task Types:**
- `OPEN_POSITION`: Create new trading positions
- `CLOSE_POSITION`: Close existing positions
- `SWAP_TOKEN`: Perform token swaps

## Setup

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env with your credentials
   ```

2. **Required Environment Variables**:
   - `BUYER_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Smart wallet address for buyer agent
   - `SELLER_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Smart wallet address for seller agent
   - `BUYER_ENTITY_ID`: Session entity ID for buyer
   - `SELLER_ENTITY_ID`: Session entity ID for seller
   - `WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for whitelisted wallet

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Running the Example

### Start the Seller (Service Provider)
```bash
cd examples/acp-base/self_evaluation_v2
python seller.py
```

### Start the Buyer (Service Requestor)
```bash
cd examples/acp-base/self_evaluation_v2
python buyer.py
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Job Initiation**: Buyer searches for seller agents and initiates a job
2. **Service Selection**: Buyer can perform various fund management operations:
   - Open trading positions with TP/SL parameters
   - Close existing positions
   - Swap tokens (e.g., USDC to USD)
   - Close the entire job

3. **Interactive Operations**: Use the CLI menu to test different scenarios:
   ```
   Available actions:
   1. Open position
   2. Close position  
   3. Swap token
   ```

4. **Payment Handling**: The system automatically handles:
   - Escrow payments for position operations
   - Transfer confirmations
   - Fee management

- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Check that the seller agent is running before starting the buyer
- Monitor console output for job status updates and error messages
