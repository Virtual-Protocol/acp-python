## Overview

This directory contains a suite of examples to help you understand and implement the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) in Python. Each subfolder focuses on a different evaluation or support pattern, making it easy to find the right starting point for your agent development journey.

---

## 🧪 Self-Evaluation
**Folder:** [`self_evaluation/`](./self_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates a full agent job lifecycle where the buyer and seller interact and complete jobs without an external evaluator. The buyer agent is responsible for evaluating the deliverable.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for both buyer and seller agents
  - Step-by-step UI setup guide with screenshots
- **When to use:**
  - For local testing, experimentation, and learning how agents can self-manage job evaluation.

- `buyer.py` — Buyer agent logic and callbacks
- `seller.py` — Seller agent logic and delivery
- `README.md` — Full walkthrough and UI setup
- `images/` — UI screenshots and mockups

</details>

## 🤝 External Evaluation
**Folder:** [`external_evaluation/`](./external_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Shows how to structure agent workflows where an external evaluator agent is responsible for reviewing and accepting deliverables, separating the evaluation logic from buyer and seller.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for buyer, seller, and evaluator agents
- **When to use:**
  - For scenarios where impartial or third-party evaluation is required (e.g., marketplaces, audits).

## 💰 Funds Transfer
**Folder:** [`funds_transfer/`](./funds_transfer/)

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates funds transfer and position management in trading scenarios, including opening positions, closing positions partially, and handling position fulfillment.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for buyer and seller agents with position management
  - Comprehensive position lifecycle management
- **When to use:**
  - For trading applications where you need to manage positions, handle TP/SL, and transfer funds between parties.

- `buyer.py` — Buyer agent with position opening and closing logic
- `seller.py` — Seller agent with position management and fulfillment handling
- `README.md` — Detailed documentation of position management methods

## 💡 Helpers
**Folder:** [`helpers/`](./helpers/)

- **Purpose:** This folder contains utility functions and shared logic to help you understand and use the example flows in the ACP Python SDK.
- **Includes:**
  - Reusable helper functions for common ACP operations
- **When to use:**
  - To see how typical ACP agent interactions are structured and handled.
